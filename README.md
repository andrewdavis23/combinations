# combinations
Create combinations of lists

Input two lists of integers and click compile to get every combination of the two lists.  Duplicates are removed.

How it works:
1. Split the input lists into arrays on '\n'
2. Remove all empty strings.  This will allow users to include empty rows in the input.
3. Format the combinations as a tab delimited list: combos += i + '\t' + j + '\n'
